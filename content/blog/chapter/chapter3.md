### 3. Biblical: submission to the Word in My Dream Church will be at a higher level than submission to leaders
(Apart from the standard doctrinal beliefs that most churches believe: http://www.vineyardusa.org/site/files/about/Vineyard%20USA%20Statement%20of%20Faith.pdf)

###### a) Berean church

In Acts 17:11, when Paul and Silas visited the Bereans, they "received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true". They knew he was an apostle with authority sent by the Jerusalem apostles. Yet, they placed submission to the Word at a higher level than submission to leaders. Now look at this: Paul was not insulted. The Holy Spirit (through Luke, the writer of Acts) commends them and holds them up as an example. "â€¦the Bereans were of nobler character". Psalm 138:2, "You have exalted above all things your name and your word."

###### b) There are 3 possible attitudes from the leadership or levels towards someone validating the message with the Word
1. suspicion and resentment  
2. tolerance  
3. encouragement

I believe that this is also one indicator of the level of spiritual maturity of a church.

###### c) I believe that most churches are at level 1.

I perceive that personal loyalty to the senior pastor is most important especially in pastor-driven churches. Submission to leaders is placed at a higher level than submission to the Word. Anyone who asks questions and attempts to validate with the Bible what is taught or practiced is treated with suspicion and resentment especially when there is discrepancy. It seems like we are forever attending classes and learning. How many people are going out to get new converts themselves, or to disciple outside the church? Do people study the Bible by themselves and pray? They have little reason to - if only pastor brings a word from God, and shares it with the church. All these make me believe that we are at the first level.

###### d) what happens where this principle is practiced (level 3)

It may seem like rebellion to say that, "our submission to the Word should be at a higher level than submission to our leaders"; the leaders may feel insecure of their position. However if you reflect on it, it is not so. In fact, it is the best way because it is God's way. Based on this, the church will respect their leaders and not back-stab ("do not speak evil of the ruler of your people"). They will not conspire nor form factions. They will submit to authority because it is in the Word. They will boldly hold their leaders and each other to the standard in the Word. The church body will themselves be strongly rooted in the Word and grow strong. It is not one-way, but reciprocal. When the leaders genuinely uphold that "our submission to the Word should be at a higher level than submission to our leaders", because of this they will prove trustworthy and righteous. When the people know this principle is genuinely true of the leaders then the church body knows they can trust them. Because they know that every effort is made by the leaders to conform to what is written, and that hidden sins do not remain hidden but are confessed and repented of. More than anything, each believer will rise up and occupy their niche. They will become strongly rooted in the Word, they will have the power of God in their lives.
