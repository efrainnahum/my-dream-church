### 7. Looking sideways (practical love):  
Jesus said, "Whatsoever you have done to the least of these among you, you have done to me". Jesus flatly commanded us to serve each other - to wash each other's feet. (John 13). In fact, he clearly says the blessings will come if we do so, "you will be blessed if you do them". In Luke 14, he tells us not to schmooze (the leadership or friends) to gain favor, but to be hospitable to those who cannot repay us, to "cast our bread upon the waters".
