### 8. The role of women:
One-flesh ministry. Women are co-laborers when they are considered one-flesh with their husbands. For example, if a man is married and is an elder, then both husband and wife are considered as one elder.

##### Are women allowed to teach?

This is a controversial topic. The apostle Paul says in 1 Timothy 2:8-15, “I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man”. 
My personal interpretation is:

a) Paul elsewhere makes blanket statements, “Cretans [inhabitant of island of Crete] are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons. This saying is true.”, in Titus 1:12. Was it just a personal outburst or an absolute and eternal truth?

b) “I do not permit…” is a personal statement.
 
c) Deborah was a warrior leader, prophetess and judge of Israel for decades. She was definitely in authority over men. Huldah was a prophetess. Philip’s daughters prophesied.

d) There is continuity from O.T. to N.T. See the table in #5. If God did not want women to teach or have authority over men, then there would have been such a restriction in the O.T. too. we would have seen it throughout. 

    I) Since women did not lead or teach often in secular life, it was not due to a stricture from God, but women were illiterate and a weaker section of society.
    II) The O.T. priests were men only. But in the N.T., all believers are priests. There is no spiritual distinction between men and women being priests. “...nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” (Galatians 3:28) 

e) There was no such prohibition from Jesus. However, all the apostles were men.

f) My Christian journey has been blessed by the teachings of women like Kay Arthur and Alaine Pakkala.

g) Apostle Paul was very sensitive to the local culture - so that the gospel would be advanced. 
He quoted their writers and even from their mythology.
During a riot, even the clerk at Ephesus defended Paul saying he had not disrespected their goddess Artemis (Acts 19).
I believe that is why Paul required women to cover their heads and remain silent - because it was so in the local culture.


I do not know if women can be senior pastors (again, Old Testament model!) but I am convinced that they can teach and preach.

####Frequently Asked Questions:

###### 1) Hasn't God appointed a leadership structure in the church? (Romans 13, Ephesians 4).
Romans 13 is about civil government, not the church. (keywords: 'taxes', 'revenue', 'rulers', 'governing authorities')
Yes, there should be leaders in the church. However it does not state in Ephesians 4 or 1 Corinthians 12 that these are seats occupied by individuals  as permanent positions.
Rather they seem to have been different hats or functional roles occupied as needed.
Paul introduces himself as an apostle in his letters because he founded the recipients' churches. From reading Acts, we see that he wore
many hats; apostle, evangelist, prophet, pastor, teacher and tent-maker.
Question to ask; does the present leadership structure of a church empower the body of Christ, and strengthen the ‘priesthood of the believer’ or does it seek to control it?
Unfortunately, many churches are tightly controlled by a small group of friends.
Leaders are required for doctrine, strategic decisions, how to spend the money, disciplining and accountability. Leaders should not take away spiritual functions that are the privilege of every member.

###### 2) You are looking for a house church.
Just because the churches in the New Testament were house churches and may have done things a certain way, does not mean churches today should be the same and follow their mechanisms exactly.
I think principles are more important than mechanisms.
Jesus rebuked the Pharisees many times for following mechanisms and ignoring principles.
It is important that the principles of the body of Christ and  priesthood of the believer be followed regardless of the mechanisms.
Again, the question to be asked is, ‘Does the mechanism reinforce the principle, or weaken and even nullify it?’
I feel the structures in today’s churches, especially for praise and worship; weaken the ‘body of Christ’ principle.

###### 3) Your pattern for praise and worship will work only in a small group.
This pattern for congregational worship is used in Plymouth Brethren churches. Bethesda Assembly in Bangalore is a regular church with a weekly attendance of over 200, and it has worked for almost a century there.
Another church where the same pattern is also followed is Good News Bible Center, Secunderabad of the Church of South India denomination. It had probably 200 members when the author was saved there.

###### 4) What about the spiritual gifts in Romans 12?
Romans 12. vs 4 For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, 5 so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. 6 We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your[a] faith; 7 if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; 8 if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead,[b] do it diligently; if it is to show mercy, do it cheerfully.

One can interpret this passage in light of the Old Testament model, or the New Testament model.
The OT model says if your gift is prophesying, then have the title of prophet and occupy the position of prophet. If it is to serve, then serve in the traffic, childcare, cooking, janitorial cleaning of toilets and building, usher, sound booth, lawn mowing etc. If it is teaching, then become a Bible study teacher in the small group, or a teaching pastor, if it is leadership, then join the leadership team (elders, board of trustees, deacons, pastors), and so on... 

There are a few problems with this view:

1) If Bob's gift is not healing, then if Tim comes to him sick, he cannot lay hands and pray for him because he does not have the gift of healing. Similarly, if Bob hears from the Holy Spirit, then it cannot be from God, because he is not a prophet. Bob should seek out one of the prophets of the church. If Bob is not a teacher, then he cannot teach what God has shown him in the Word, this past week.
In other words, it discourages the lay congregation from stepping into the power of the Holy Spirit that is available to us all. It says that only a select few are anointed - the rest can sign up to serve, give etc. Of course, this is false - 1 John says we are all anointed.
Must only those who have the gift of healing lay hands and pray for the sick? Jesus disproved it when he said that all believers must do so.
Mark 16:17 “And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name... they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.”

2) How will you interpret the gifts of encouraging, mercy, serving, giving in verses 7,8? There is no title nor office for these. Instead it is everyone's duty to give, serve, encourage, be merciful.
As a practical observation, leaders, teachers, apostles and the other positions, rarely if ever, leave their positions to do menial, lower status work.

In contrast, the NT model encourages every believer to lay hands on and pray for the sick, to hear from the Holy Spirit, to preach the gospel, to teach someone a truth God has shown her, to give, to serve, to encourage etc. I believe Romans 12 is actually saying, if you have a gift in an area, then exercise it to the maximum extent so that you will benefit others. Do not be lukewarm about it. Note the keywords: generous, cheerful, diligent.
The apostle Paul applied this model to himself. He was apostle, pastor, teacher, evangelist, tentmaker (service), prophet, working healing and miracles, speaking in tongues, encouraging, giving, but he identifies his gift as apostle. 

###### 5) How are church workers and leaders paid?
Everyone should be paid only part-time and should have a secular job. Everyone who teaches must be paid for their work and time and effort in preparing. for instance if you spend 15 hours a week to prepare the sermon in addition to your regular job, then you should be paid well; 15 hours * $50/hour (say) = $750. However the preaching would be shared by the elders.

###### 7) Our church members are not mature enough.
This is an unfortunate remark because God is especially close to the new believer. For instance, every new believer can pray even if they are simple prayers.
