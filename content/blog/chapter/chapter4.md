### 4. Leaders should have secular jobs:
There are numerous passages in the NT to show that everyone had secular jobs (1 Thessalonians 4:11 "each of you should work with his hands") - this included Paul, Silas, Timothy. Only full-time evangelists were supported financially (1Corinthians 9:14 “the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel”). Jesus worked as a carpenter or stone mason (‘tekton’) for likely over 80% of his career. When he became a full-time evangelist, he was supported financially.

As mentioned above, apostle, evangelist, pastor, teacher are roles for service rather than positions in a hierarchy. According to this, pastors and staff should not work for free - they should be paid for their work, but part-time. Having a secular primary job lets them practice and demonstrate what a good employee is like, in the outside world. It also reduces the pressure on him for his financial needs and for his family. Working part-time in the church allows sharing of the spiritual work with the rest of the members.

In the Old Covenant, priests did the spiritual work (God resided in the temple).  The rest supported them financially. In the New Covenant, everyone is a priest and supposed to do spiritual work because all believers have the Holy Spirit.
