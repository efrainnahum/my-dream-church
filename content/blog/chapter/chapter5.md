### 5. Finances: Giving not Tithing. Transparency in finances.
New Testament Christians are not required to tithe (give 10% of their income to the church).
Giving is freewill; however it must be regular, generous, proportional to income and cheerfully given. 
If every follower of Jesus is a priest, then our giving should go to help support the ‘priests’ who are in need.

2 Corinthians 9:7 "Each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.". Jesus commanded his church to practice Love, Baptism, Communion,  Conflict-resolution (Matthew 18), and Preaching the Gospel. He never asked his church to tithe!

Resources proving that tithing is not for today (http://www.tithing-russkelly.com/, John MacArthur http://www.gty.org/resources/questions/QA144).
Commit to transparency in finances. Reveal details of expenses and not roll them into larger headings which avoids scrutiny.
