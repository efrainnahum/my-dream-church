### 6. Praise and Worship is congregational:
In the Old Testament, praise and worship was controlled by certain anointed ones; Miriam, the sons of Kohath and others.
Since the body of Christ everyone has the anointing, praise and worship should be participatory. It is not just a praise and worship team that must lead, in a carefully choreographed performance.
Perhaps after a few songs led by the team, anyone who is a member and filled with a desire to worship and praise God, and feels the Holy Spirit leading him or her to do so, can start a chorus, hymn or praise song with everyone joining in; or pray or read a passage from the Bible or speak briefly about what God has shown him in the Word or speak a word or revelation (after it is cleared beforehand by those with the gift of discernment). These are not performances nor sermons nor teaching, but must be praise. The elders should preach, not just the senior pastor. Not out of routine, but when they are filled with the Holy Spirit and God has taught them something from the Word.
What I described is essentially congregational worship.
It is the right of every member of the church, not simply those who are spiritually gifted or those with titles and positions.
Note: to prevent abuse of this freedom, if anyone gets up and speaks departing from the guidelines above, then the leaders can ask him to sit down.

###### a) 1 Corinthians 14:26

"When you come together, everyone has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an interpretation. All of these must be done for the strengthening of the church".
Note that 

1) this is when the church meets together, and not in a small group meeting.
2) it is ‘everyone’, not just a chosen few.
3) it is a prayer (vs 14,15), praise song, a teaching, a sharing of what God has shown backed by the Word, prophecy, tongue, and the interpretation. It is the exercising of both natural and supernatural gifts.
4) All this must happen for the church to be strengthened. If you want your church to be strengthened - all the believers, not just a few - then all of the above should be encouraged, for everyone, and there should be a time in which this can be practised during the main meeting. This can be interpreted as a promise.

###### b) 1 Peter 2:5

"you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house[Or into a temple of the Spirit] to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
In churches perhaps from a desire to control, or inexperience with the concept, leaders insist this must be done in a small group and that only pastors can speak in a service. This is not biblical.

###### Notes:

a) There was no mike at the front in our churches in India during participatory worship. People stood up at their seats to pray, or start a song or share something from the Bible related to praise of God. This enables even shy people to participate. Perhaps they can stand up and the cordless mike brought to them.

b) The best effects are when the worship is pointed towards God, rather than man. It should also be linked to scripture. I feel that prayer, praise song, sharing something from the Bible related to praise of God has more of these attributes than (say) a testimony or dream or vision that does not reference any scripture at all.

1) referencing scripture provides us with a way to evaluate or verify what is being said. Otherwise if there is no way to verify, one can go into deception.
2) referencing scripture provides everyone with a shared common point from which others can also 'take off'.

c) Perhaps time limits can be observed by projecting a flashing square on the wall (easily implemented) after 2 minutes and flashing red after 3 minutes. Perhaps it can be done from PowerPoint.
